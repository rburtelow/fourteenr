# 🔒 Strongly Recommended Next Step

For a platform like My14er, you should also publish:

* A **Privacy Policy** (especially if using Supabase, analytics, auth providers)
* A short **Community Guidelines** page (simpler tone than legal Terms)

If you'd like, I can draft:

* A Privacy Policy tailored to Supabase + OAuth
* A Community Guidelines page that matches the outdoor/hiking culture
* A more aggressive liability-protective version (stronger risk shielding)
* Or a simplified “early MVP” version suitable for beta launch
